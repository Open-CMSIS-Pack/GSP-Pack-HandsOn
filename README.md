# Software Pack Hands-On Example

This repository contains a simple software pack hands-on example. It is created by the imaginary "ACME Corp." and
contains bundles for an *evaluation* and a *commercial* version of a software component that is available in two flavors:
*debug* and *release*. The component can be selected multiple times.

In the repository, you will find a `gen_pack.sh` script that is used to build the pack. 

A workflow to build the pack on GitHub is available in [`.github/workflows/pack.yaml`](./.github/workflows/pack.yaml)
